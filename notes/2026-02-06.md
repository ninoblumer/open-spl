Generated files for testing.

## Setup
**Gerator**: NTi Minirator MR-Pro (internal Nr. 3) was used to generate the signals.  
**SLM**: Nti XL2-TA RTA/SLM (type approved) S/N A2a-11831-E4 (internal Nr. 4) was used to measure.  
**XLR**: A Neutrik 1.5 m XLR cable was used to connect the two.  
**BNC** A 1.5 m BNC cable with RCA adaptors on both ends was also tried but appeared to deliver the same levels as the XLR.  

## Calibration
The **generator** was set to emit a 1'000 kHz sine tone at a level of -26.0 dBV. The **SLM** was calibrated at 94.0 dB with that signal. Thus setting the sensitivity to -26.0 dBV which corresponds to 50.1 mV/Pa.

## Test File Generation
The **generator** was then set to generate a range of signals, and the **SLM** captured these signals while logging the measurements.
The **SLM** was set to report all values and all spectra and to log Leq spectra and all values with a dt = 1 s. Audio was recorded at 24Bit_48kHz. 
The **SLM** was set to range = 20...120 dB.

000: calibration signal (sine 1kHz -26.0dBV): 10s (signal before recording)
001: chirp -26.0dBV (20 - 20kHz, Log, t=10s, tpause=0): 30s (silence before recording)
002: chirp -80.0dBV (20 - 20kHz, Log, t=10s, tpause=0): 30s (silence before recording)
003: pink noise -26.0 dBV: 10s (signal before recording)
004: pink noise -80.0 dBV: 10s (signal before recording)
